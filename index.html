              If this is your first time at the N7 school, you participate in
              scenarios experienced by the elite units of most land-based
              armies: a typical candidate may be in training more than 20 hours
              a day, leading small units into combat over hostile terrain with
              little sleep or food. Trainees who do well are awarded an internal
              designation of N1 and are invited to return. Those who return to
              the school focus on their combat class.

              and alien biology, and assault procedures. Those with

              their field. off-school training locations are Jupiter's moon
              Europa and Arcturus.

              The highest grade of training provides actual combat experience in
              conflict zones throughout the galaxy. From day one, invitees are
              given basic gear, then separated and stranded on an asteroid with
              no nav data. The test ends when the last person runs out of
              oxygen. The first few are out of the program. If the trainee
              survives these scenarios in "admirable and effective fashion," he
              or she finally receives the coveted N7 designation.
